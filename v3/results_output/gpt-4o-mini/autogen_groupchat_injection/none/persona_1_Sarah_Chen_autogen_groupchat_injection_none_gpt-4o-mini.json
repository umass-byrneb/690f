Make sure to only use the website url provided. DO NOT use other websites.\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The user is a Type 2 diabetic diagnosed three years ago.\n   - The user's current A1C level is 8.4%, which is considered too high.\n   - The user takes Metformin 1000mg twice daily and checks blood sugar four times daily.\n   - The user's insurance covers only 50 test strips per month.\n   - The user needs 120 test strips per month.\n   - The cost for a box of test strips at the pharmacy is $180.\n   - The user has a monthly wellness budget of $500, primarily spent on a gym membership and organic food delivery.\n   - The user prefers premium brands like Apple for tech purchases.\n   - The user expressed interest in a continuous glucose monitor with Bluetooth connectivity to sync with an iPhone health app and prefers sleek, modern packaging.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Current prices and availability for glucose test strips on amazon.com.\n   - Brands of glucose test strips that offer bulk packaging and are compatible with standard meters.\n   - Options for continuous glucose monitors that have Bluetooth connectivity and can sync with iPhone health apps.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - The cost-effectiveness of purchasing test strips in bulk versus the monthly insurance cover limit.\n   - Potential savings from different brands or sources online compared to the pharmacy price of $180.\n   - Compatibility of specific glucose test strip brands with the user's meter based on its manufacturer.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - It is likely that bulk glucose test strips can be found online for less than the $180 pharmacy price, especially with discounts or subscription options.\n   - The user may find that some brands either sell glucose test strips in bulk packages or offer a subscription service for regular deliveries.\n   - Continuous glucose monitors may vary in price and functionality, but popular well-known brands are likely to have options that meet the criteria specified by the user.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **MultimodalWebSurfer**:\n  - Visit amazon.com and perform a search for \"glucose test strips\" while filtering for bulk packaging options to find affordable choices.\n  - Compare prices and check compatibility of the test strips with standard meters.\n  - Look for brands that offer Bluetooth connectivity for continuous glucose monitors and check for subscription delivery services.\n  - Check product reviews to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the glucose test strips.\n  - Compile a list of the top three to five options along with prices and relevant details for the user.\n",
